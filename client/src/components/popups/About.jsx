      <h3>About smol</h3>
      <p>Smol is a small demo project I built to shorten urls.</p>
      <p>
        Its main goal is to display my coding skills, using react and python
        flask in a quick and interesting project
      </p>
      <p>
        As a demo, smol's database will not keep your urls more than 72 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        Smol is an open source project, you can check out how it's built in in
        its github repository => http://smol.com/Janxa (see what i did there ?
        :)).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any question, feedback, or if you encountered a bug, you can
        contact me using the contact form of the website, I check my mails
        everyday !
